# Amazon Web Scraper and Chatbot

This repository offers a robust solution that combines the power of web scraping and conversational AI. It features a web scraper tailored to extract data from Amazon's search results for any given search term and subsequently stores this data in a CSV file. The contained chatbot utilizes this CSV to deliver informative responses to user inquiries.

## How It Works

### Web Scraper:
- **Libraries Utilized**: `csv`, `bs4`, and `selenium`.
- **Functionality**:
  - Generates the search results URL based on a user-specified search term.
  - Extracts relevant product information from Amazon's search result pages.
  - Saves the compiled data to a CSV file for later use.

### Chatbot:
- **Libraries Utilized**: `streamlit`, `langchain`, and `OpenAI`.
- **Functionality**:
  - Reads and processes data from the CSV generated by the web scraper.
  - Segments the data text into manageable chunks.
  - Engages the OpenAI API to generate embeddings and retrieve pertinent data segments.
  - Constructs a comprehensive response to the user's query, drawing from the data.

## Use Case

This tool is invaluable for those wanting insights about Amazon products without the manual labor of sifting through search results. With a straightforward query, such as requesting the "top 5 products based on reviews", the chatbot can rapidly deliver precise results, drawing from the stored CSV data. This process not only enhances user efficiency by sidestepping the conventional search process but also guarantees accuracy in results.

## Requirements

- `csv`
- `bs4`
- `selenium`
- `streamlit`
- `langchain`
- `OpenAI`

Ensure you have the above libraries installed. You can typically install these with `pip`:

```bash
pip install bs4 selenium streamlit langchain OpenAI
```

(Note: Some of these libraries may have additional dependencies.)

## How to Use

To engage with the `chatbot.py`:

1. Ensure you've scraped the desired data using the web scraper.
2. Navigate to the repository's root directory in your command prompt or terminal.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m streamlit run chatbot.py
```
