# Amazon Web Scraper and Chatbot

This repository contains code for a web scraper that extracts data from Amazon's search results for a given search term and saves it to a CSV file. The data is then used by a chatbot to generate responses to user queries.

## How it works

The web scraper uses the `csv`, `bs4`, and `selenium` libraries to scrape data from Amazon's search results page. The code defines several functions to generate the URL for the search results page, extract relevant information from the page, and save the data to a CSV file.

The chatbot uses the `streamlit`, `langchain`, and `OpenAI` libraries to create a user interface for asking questions and generating responses. The code reads data from the CSV file generated by the web scraper, splits the text into chunks, and uses the OpenAI API to generate embeddings and retrieve relevant information. The chatbot then uses this information to generate a response to the user's query.

## Use case

This code can be used to create a chatbot that can answer questions about products on Amazon based on data scraped from the website. For example, a user could ask the chatbot to show them the top 5 products based on reviews, and the chatbot would generate a response using the data from the CSV file.
One of the benefits of using this code is that it saves users time by automatically navigating through pages of Amazon search results and extracting relevant product information. Instead of manually searching for products and reading through pages of reviews, users can simply ask the chatbot specific questions about products and receive quick and accurate responses based on data stored in the CSV file.
